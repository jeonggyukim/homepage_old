Almost all stars in the present-day Universe are believed to form in clusters
embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We performed a suite of radiation
hydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation in turbulent GMCs, focusing
on how radiation feedback controls the net star formation efficiency (SFE) and
the lifetime of natal clouds.
