# About

I am a sixth (and final) year graduate student in the Department of Physics and
Astronomy at Seoul National University, Republic of Korea, working
with [Prof. Woong-Tae Kim](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~wkim) for my PhD degree. I
expect to defend my dissertation in June, 2018. My research focus is on
theoretical and computational astrophysics in the areas of star formation and
interstellar medium (ISM). The primary goal of my thesis is to understand the
dynamics of ionized bubbles ("HII regions") formed around young star clusters
and their impact on natal molecular clouds.

Using linear stability analysis as well as numerical simulations, I have
previously studied gravitational instability of a gaseous disk confined by an
external pressure, interfacial instability of evaporation fronts in the
two-phase ISM, wiggle instability of galactic spiral shocks, and instability of
ionization fronts surrounding HII regions.
