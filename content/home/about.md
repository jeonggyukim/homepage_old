# About

I am a sixth (and final) year PhD student in the Department of Physics and
Astronomy at Seoul National University, Republic of Korea. I am working
with [Prof. Woong-Tae Kim](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~wkim) and expect to defend my
dissertation in June, 2018. My research focus is on theoretical and
computational astrophysics in the areas of star formation and interstellar
medium (ISM). The primary goal of my thesis is to understand the dynamics of
ionized bubbles ("HII regions") formed around young star clusters and their
impact on natal molecular clouds.

Using linear stability analysis as well as numerical simulations, I have
previously studied gravitational instability of a gaseous disk confined by an
external pressure, interfacial instability of evaporation fronts in the
two-phase ISM, wiggle instability of galactic spiral shocks, and instability of
ionization fronts surrounding HII regions.
