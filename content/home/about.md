# About

I am a first-year postdoc in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at
Princeton University. I received my PhD from Seoul National University in 2018.
My research focus is on theoretical and computational astrophysics in the areas
of star formation and interstellar medium (ISM). The primary goal of my research
is to understand the impact of UV radiation from massive stars on the evolution
of molecular clouds and diffuse ISM.

Prior to embarking on the thesis project, I studied gravitational instability of
a gaseous disk confined by an external pressure, interfacial instability of
evaporation fronts in the two-phase ISM, wiggle instability of galactic spiral
shocks, and instability of magnetized ionization fronts surrounding HII regions.
