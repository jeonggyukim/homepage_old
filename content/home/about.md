# About

I am a sixth (and final) year graduate student in the Department of Physics and
Astronomy at Seoul National University, Republic of Korea. I am working
with [Prof. Woong-Tae Kim](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~wkim) for my PhD degree. My
main research interest is in understanding the dynamics of ionized bubbles ("HII
regions") formed around young star clusters and their impact on natal molecular
clouds.

Using linear stability analysis as well as numerical simulations, I have
previously studied gravitational instability of a thin layer confined by an
external pressure, interfacial instability of evaporation fronts in the ISM,
wiggle instability of galactic spiral shocks, and instability of ionization
fronts surrounding HII regions.
